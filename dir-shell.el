;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The package provides a variety of different ways to interact with
;; the current working directory of a shell buffer. While Emacs
;; provides a variety of commands for interacting with the shell, and
;; an array of commands for doing many of the tasks that users can do
;; from the shell (deleting, moving and copying files for instance),
;; using an interactive shell within Emacs is none the less an
;; intuitive way of augmenting Emacs' functionality, with that
;; provided by the native shell. 
;; 
;; One of the difficulties with this though, is that the user often
;; wishes to use the shell in many different working directories. This
;; is particularly true, with some languages, such as Java, which
;; require frequent traversal of many directories.
;;
;; This package provides a number of ways of helping this
;; process. More descriptions of these ways will be added as I code
;; them.

;;; Status:
;;
;; Early days yet, in fact, just chopped out of my .emacs. 

;;; Todo:
;; 1) rewrite properly.
;; 2) As well as shifting the existing *shell*, offer the ability to
;; open a new shell, named after the buffer.
;; 3) Can I cope with different shell types? "cd" should work, but
;; "pwd" might not. 
;; 4) Insinuate with ECB, speedbar.
;; 5) Custom support. 
;; 6) shift-to-current-dir offer prompt for which shell buffer. 
;; 7) eshell support?
;; 8) global minor mode for keybindings. 
;; 9) The "cd" command results in a prompt coming back which is
;; nasty. Don't know how to stop it.
